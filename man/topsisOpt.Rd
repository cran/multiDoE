\title{Technique for Order of Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS)}
\usage{
topsisOpt(out, w = NULL, p = 2)
}
\arguments{
\item{out}{A list as the \code{megaAR} list returned by \code{\link[multiDoE]{runTPLS}}.}

\item{w}{A vector of weights. It must sum to 1. The default wights are uniform.}

\item{p}{A coefficient. It determines the type of distance used. The default value is 2.}
}
\value{
The function returns a list containing the following items:
\itemize{
\item{\code{ranking}: A dataframe containing the ranking values of S(x) and the
ordered indexes according to the TOPSIS approach (from the best to the worst).}
\item{\code{bestScore}: The scores of the best solution.}
\item{\code{bestSol}: The best solution.}
}
}
\description{
This function implements Technique for Order of Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS).
This approach is based on the principle that the best solutions must be near to a positive ideal
solution \eqn{(I+)} and far from a negative ideal solution \eqn{(I-)} in the
criteria space. The weighted distance measure used to detect these similarities
allows the user to possibly assign different importance to the criteria considered.
The distance measure used is:
\deqn{L_p(a,b) = \left[ \sum_{j=1}^{m}(w_j)^p(|a-b|)^p\right] ^(1/p)}{%
L_p(a,b) = [ \sum{j=1}^{m}(w_j^p * |a-b|^p]^{(1/p)}}
The metric on the basis of which solution ranking occurs is:

\deqn{S(x) = \frac{L_p(x,I-)}{(L_p(x,I+) + L_p(x,I-)}}{%
S(x) = L_p(x,I-) / (L_p(x,I+) + L_p(x,I-))}
}
